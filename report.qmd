# General Introduction

Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease in which the body’s immune system attacks and destroys the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. Without treatment, or in cases of poor disease management, T1D can lead to serious complications such as diabetic ketoacidosis and hypoglycemia. In France, around 4,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and between 2018 and 2022, approximately 180,000 people were living with T1D. This rising incidence—estimated at an average annual rate of 2\% to 5\% in pediatric populations—suggests that T1D is a growing public health concern.

The origin of T1D is complex, involving a combination of genetic predisposition and environmental triggers. Numerous environmental and socio-demographic factors have been associated with the development of the disease, although their impact may vary across regions and populations. In France, for instance, the prevalence of T1D is not evenly distributed across regions. [insert regional numbers in 2023] These regional disparities suggest that external factors—such as lifestyle, access to healthcare, socioeconomic conditions, and potential environmental exposures like pollution and climate—may influence disease risk. Identifying at-risk individuals early and gaining a clearer understanding of the specific environmental contributors to T1D remain key public health challenges. 

Our study focuses on inference rather than prediction. Our goal is to better understand the relationship between environmental, social and economic factors and the incidence of T1D. We aim to assess how various exposures—such as air pollution, access to healthcare services, or socio-demographic variables—may influence the likelihood of developing T1D in different districts. [to develop]

To conduct our analysis, we combine individual-level hospital data from the French PMSI (Information systems medicalization program) with a wide range of open-access external datasets. We received additional data from Sanofi, including environmental variables such as air pollution and gas emissions, as well as socio-economic indicators at the district level. To capture the local environment more precisely, we integrated SIRENE data, which provides information on both commercial (e.g., food stores, fitness centers) and public infrastructure. We further enrich our dataset with meteorological data from Météo France.

# Literature Review

For our project, it is crucial to understand what the existing literature says about environmental and social risk factors for Type 1 diabetes. Reviewing this literature help us identify the most studied factors and the remaining research gaps. This section summarizes key findings across several factors, from air pollution and nutrition to stress and socioeconomic conditions.

Air pollution is among the most studied environmental factors in recent years regarding the risk of T1D onset, especially in children. ozone (O3), nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5) are known for their effects on inflammation, oxidative stress and immune regulation. Numerous studies support that exposure to these air pollutants during pregnancy or early life could contribute to higher risk of developing T1D. 
A Canadian study carried out by Elten et al. (2020) examined around 750k children and found that maternal exposure to ozone during first trimester of pregnancy is associated to increased risk of early-onset pediatric diabetes. A study in Israel by Taha-Khalde et al (2021) supported this result by showing that children whose mothers were exposed to high concentration of O3 (third and fourth quartiles) during pregnancy had higher chances of developing T1D. However, Taha-Khalde also investigated the role of PM10 and PM2.5 exposure but found no clear associations after adjusting for socioeconomic status and meteorological conditions. A study carried out in California by Hathout et al. (2006) also found that children with T1D had higher cumulative exposure to O3 from birth, which reinforces the potential association between long-term ozone exposure and autoimmune diabetes.
Finally, in Poland, Michalska et al. (2020) explored regional variation in air pollution and T1D incidence. They found a significant positive correlation between annual average PM10 levels and incidence of T1D among children aged between 0 and 18. However, they found no significant correlation between NO2 levels and incidence of T1D in this population. The literature seems to suggest that NO2 plays a secondary role compared to oxidative pollutants like ozone and fine particulate matter. 

Another widely researched factor is vitamin D, it is seen as a protective factor because of its role in the immune system and pancreatic function. The active form of vitamin D (1,25(OH)2D3) attaches to receptors (VDR) present immune cells and beta cells, where it helps regulate immune responses by limiting inflammation and promoting immune tolerance, which could reduce the likelihood of the immune system attacking the beta-cells, as in T1D. Also, vitamin D contributes to calcium balance, essential for proper insulin secretion. 
Many observational studies suggest that vitamin D supplementation during childhood might lower the risk on developing T1D. A large Finnish birth cohort study by Hyppönen et al. (2001) found that supplementation of vitamin D during childhood was associated with an 88% lower risk of developing T1D compared to children who didn’t receive vitamin D. The EURODIAB case control-study confirmed this result, showing vitamin D supplementation in infancy was associated with 33% lower odds of developing T1D later in life. A meta-analysis – conducted by Zipitis and Akobeng (2008) – using five studies supported those findings, showing that children with supplementation of vitamin D had 29% lower risk of developing T1D compared to other children. 
Vitamin D is primarily produced in the skin through exposure to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays from sunlight, making sun exposure an essential component for maintaining high level of vitamin D. Geographic differences in UVB quantities – determined by latitude and cloud coverage – can therefore influence vitamin D status in population. A studied by Mohr et al. (2008) carried out during several years among children aged 0-14 in 51 regions worldwide found that higher regional USB irradiance was strongly associated with lower incidence rates of T1D in children. The study observed a clear variation with latitude: regions closer to the equator, with greater UVB exposure, had significantly lower T1D incidence compared to regions farther from the equator.
Despite consistent results across numerous studies, these results don’t establish a causal relationship between supplementation of vitamin D during childhood and development of T1D. Most studies are observational and rely on retrospective data, often based on parental recall of supplementation, without objective measurements of vitamin D levels. There are still many questions about ideal dose, timing and duration and heterogeneity effects. 


Dietary factors are known to have an impact on the onset of Type 2 diabetes, but they have also been examined in relation to T1D, especially through its impact on immune development and pancreatic beta-cell stress. Several dietary factors during pregnancy, infancy or childhood could contribute to either increasing or reducing risk of developing Type 1 diabetes.  Early exposure to certain foods, such as cow’s milk or processed meats, has been associated with a higher risk, possibly due to the presence of inflammatory compounds like nitrites and advanced glycation end-products that may promote beta-cell damage​ (Virtanen 2016). 
Many prospective and case-control studies have investigated the effects of diet on the onset of T1D. Early introduction of cow’s milk and short breastfeeding duration have both been associated with an increased risk of islet autoimmunity and T1D, particularly when they occur in the first months of life​ (Virtanen 2016). In a Swedish cohort-study, short breastfeeding and early cow’s milk exposure were associated with higher risk of autoantibody development. Furthermore, early introduction of solid foods has also been linked to a higher risk of islet autoimmunity in genetically susceptible children. A randomized trial found that giving infants a hydrolyzed formula instead of a standard cow’s milk–based formula in the first 6-8 months of life could delay the emergence of islet cell autoimmunity. 
According to studies, diet continues to play a role in older children. A Swedish study found that children developing T1D had significantly higher intakes of energy, carbohydrates, and especially sugars compared to other children​. High sugar consumption remained a significant risk factor after adjusting for total energy intake, suggesting a specific impact beyond general overnutrition. Moreover, Traversi et al (2020) conducted a small study on children of Italian origin and migrant families in Italy, which included 40 cases and 56 controls. They observed a modest but significant association between higher total caloric intake and the likelihood of developing T1D. In particular, high intake of protein, fat, or carbohydrates individually was also associated with a slightly increased risk of the disease. 
Evidence suggests that family dietary habits - especially those influencing early nutrition and energy intake - could play a role in shaping T1D risk. However, a clear causal relationship between diet and T1D has not been established. Most studies are observational and may be influenced by bias or confounding factors.


In addition to physical exposures, psychological stress has been proposed as a possible trigger for T1D, particularly when stress occurs during sensitive developmental periods. Two studies have studied this relation in the context of acute, traumatic life events. Zung et al. (2012) reported a significant increase in T1D incidence among Israeli children following the Second Lebanon War, suggesting that important levels of psychological stress may act as a trigger​. Virk et al. (2010) found that children whose mothers experienced the death of a close family member during pregnancy - particularly in cases of sudden or traumatic loss, such as the death of a partner or a child - were at greater risk of developing T1D, with the association being especially strong among girls​. 
However, the idea that « post-traumatic » type 1 diabetes exists remain controversial. The literature is inconsistent, some studies report a clear link between traumatic life events and diabetes onset, and other studies, including studies conducted in high-prevalence countries like Sweden, find no such association. (Littorin et al. 2001) 
A key limitation of the literature on the relation between stress and type 1 diabetes is the narrow focus on extreme events such as wars or losses of loved ones. Few studies have focused on chronic and everyday stressors such as school pressure, neighborhood criminality or family instability and their influence on developing T1D. Furthermore, most studies don’t include physiological data (cortisol levels or immune markers), making it difficult how stress contribute to autoimmune processes. 


Tobacco use and exposure have also raised concerns regarding onset of T1D, due to their known effects on insulin secretion and pancreatic beta-cell function. While smoking is well known for its effects on insulin resistance, evidence also points to its role in impairing insulin secretion. A Japanese cohort study by Morimoto et al. (2013), which followed around 2k men over several years, found that current smokers were nearly twice as likely to develop impaired insulin secretion compared to men who never smoke. The risk increased in a dose-dependent manner with the number of pack-years smoked, suggesting a cumulative effect. Interestingly, smoking was not significantly associated with insulin resistance in this cohort, reinforcing the idea that smoking may directly damage beta cells rather than simply altering insulin sensitivity​. 
A Swedish study confirmed those results showing that smokers had significantly lower beta-cell function that people who had never smoked, indicating reduced insulin secretion capacity. Notably, this association was not observed in women, suggesting possible sex-specific biological responses to tobacco exposure​. The mechanism at stake here is that smoking is associated with increased oxidative stress and inflammation, both of which could contribute to beta-cell apoptosis or dysfunction. 
While these studies show that smoking can impair beta-cell function, they do not clearly link smoking to the development of T1D itself. Most research focuses on adults and does not address early-life exposure, when T1D typically begins.


Lastly, socioeconomic factors are increasingly studied as potential non-genetic contributors to T1D. Several studies suggest socioeconomic factors can influence access to healthcare and exposure to environmental factors and behavioral risk factors, which may affect onset of T1D. The study by Traversi et al. (2020) showed that children receiving regular health check-ups were significantly less likely to develop the disease (odds ratio of 0.37). This finding shows the importance of access to healthcare and early monitoring. 
Further analyses support the idea that regional deprivation is associated with higher T1D incidence. A large study by Buchmann et al. (2023), using registry data from nearly 25,000 children in Germany, found that districts with very high socioeconomic deprivation (as measured by the German Index of Socioeconomic Deprivation, GISD) had a higher incidence of T1D compared to those with very low deprivation. Another study carried in Germany by Prel et al. (2007) showed that higher deprivation scores – based on income, education and professional training – were significantly associated with increased T1D incidence across regions. The study also reported a clear linear trend, with incidence rising as deprivation increased. 
It is common to use income of the household, education of parents to measure socioeconomic status. However, they may act as proxies for more complex underlying mechanisms. These includes differences in health behaviors, nutrition quality, stress exposure, and healthcare access, which may not be fully captured by standard indicators. Low parental education could be associated with reduced health literacy, leading to delayed recognition of early T1D symptoms or poor diabetes management. Income may reflect a family's ability to access healthy food, stable housing and preventive care, which are factors that could affect the likelihood of developing T1D. 
Despite the associations found in these studies, there is no definitive evidence that low socioeconomic status directly causes T1D. Most available studies are observational and cannot account for individual-level confounding or causal mechanisms. Moreover, results are not always consistent across countries and time periods, possibly due to differences in healthcare systems, social safety nets, and population genetics.

# Methodological Overview

Selecting variables for the primary model presented a significant challenge due to the numerous features available in the rich dataset created during this project. While automatic variable selection techniques, such as the elastic net, were considered, they are ill-suited to this research's primary goal: inference rather than prediction (as established in the introduction).

Employing variable selection methods driven by relationships within the dataset itself compromises subsequent statistical inference. Most notably, it renders p-values unreliable for controlling the risk of Type I errors. Furthermore, automatic selection introduces interpretative difficulties. In observational settings often characterized by unobserved heterogeneity, it becomes challenging to discern the substantive reasons for a variable's inclusion beyond its predictive performance or simple correlation with the outcome (here, T1D).

Therefore, we adopted a manual selection approach. This allows us to incorporate variables based on pre-defined hypotheses regarding their potential influence, informed by theoretical considerations from the literature, results from our exploratory PCA (which excluded T1D-related variables), and descriptive statistics concerning seasonality and associated diagnoses. For transparency, the justification for each chosen variable is provided in the annex to this report. We add or remove certains controls after modelling to evaluate sensitivity of our estimates. 

Our primary analysis employs Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models to explain the number of "new cases" observed at various geographical levels. To address inherent concerns about the ecological fallacy, where aggregate-level associations may not accurately reflect individual-level risks, we leverage data across different geographic levels and conduct heterogeneity analyses within selected sub-populations. Finding consistent results across these different levels and groups strengthens the evidence for the robustness of inference.

However, given the limitations common to observational studies, our initial findings are still sensitive to the specific set of control variables included in the model. Therefore, we identify promising explanatory variables from these primary models to investigate further using methods designed for more robust causal inference, treating these variables conceptually as "treatments." \newpage 

Specifically, we conduct subsequent analyses using either:

1.	**Panel data models with fixed effects**: This approach utilizes longitudinal data to control for time-invariant unobserved characteristics of the geographical units.
2.	**Double/Debiased Machine Learning (DDML)**: This technique uses machine learning to flexibly control for a potentially large number of confounding variables, aiming to provide less biased estimates of the "treatment" effect. While mechanically different, DDML shares a fundamental goal with methods like propensity score matching: estimating treatment effects by creating comparable conditions between units exposed and unexposed to the "treatment." Furthermore, DDML inherently aids in managing high-dimensional controls through a predictive first-stage estimation.

# Results and Comments

As previously mentioned, we employ the widely used Poisson regression model to analyze the number of "incident" cases within specific French geographic units, the *bassins de vie 2022* (BV) and *arrondissements administratifs*. This model assumes that the case count $Y_i$ in unit $i$, conditional on a set of covariates $X_i$, follows a Poisson distribution: $Y_i | X_i \sim \mathcal{P}(\lambda_i)$. Model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation. The core of the model links the expected number of cases to covariates and population size through the conditional mean:
$$E[Y_i | \mathbf{X}_i, \text{pop}_i] = \lambda_i = \text{pop}_i\cdot\exp(\mathbf{X}_i^T \boldsymbol{\beta})$$
Here, $\text{pop}_i$ denotes the reference population under 30 years of age within the geographic unit $i$, serving as an offset that scales incidence risk to the relevant population size. The vector $\mathbf{X}_i$ includes both the control variables and variables of interest defined previously.

A key assumption of the Poisson model is the equality of its conditional mean and variance: $E[Y_i \mid \mathbf{X}_i] = \text{Var}(Y_i \mid \mathbf{X}_i) = \lambda_i$. However, our data exhibit evidence of a slight overdispersion (variance exceeding the mean), with calculated dispersion indices ranging from 1.2 to 1.5. To account for this, we also estimate a Negative Binomial (NB) regression model. The NB model typically retains the same structure for the conditional mean $\mu_i$ as the Poisson model but incorporates an additional dispersion parameter $\alpha$ to allow for greater variance:
$$ \mu_i = \text{pop}_i \cdot \exp(\mathbf{X}_i \boldsymbol{\beta}) \ \ \ \text{Var}(Y_i | \mathbf{X}_i) = \mu_i + \alpha \mu_i^2$$
This approach offers greater flexibility in modeling the variance compared to the standard Poisson model. While estimating the NB model can sometimes lead to instability, particularly with smaller sample sizes, it directly addresses the issue of overdispersion. For comparison, estimates from both the Poisson and NB models are presented in the following table, where (1) is the NB model at the arrondissement level, (2) is the NB model at the BV level, (3) is a Poisson model at the arrondissement level and finally, (4) is a Poisson model at the BV level.

## Main Poisson and NB

```{python}
#| results: asis
#| output: asis
#| tbl-cap: "Main Regression Results"

print(build_table(
        MAIN_RESULTS[MAIN_RESULTS['description'].str.endswith(("arr24", "bv2022"))],
        include_pval=True,
        midrule_after=26,
        exclude_pattern=default_pattern
    ))
```

The regression coefficients are reported as Incidence Rate Ratios (IRR), calculated $\exp(\beta_x)$. An IRR greater than 1 indicates a positive association with the incidence rate, while an IRR less than 1 indicates a negative association. Given the limited sample size, we consider three significance levels: 0.1, 0.05, and 0.01, denoted by one to three stars, respectively. Full regression outputs are available in Annex A.1.

### Socioeconomic Principal Components

At the arrondissement level, PC3, which we interpret as capturing predominantly low to middle education, is statistically significant and associated with an increase in incidence rates. At the BV level, PC1, representing high education and high income, is significant and negatively associated with incidence. Also at the BV level, PC, defined as middle education with high first decile income, is significant (but less than PC1) and negatively associated with incidence. These support our hypothesis that the correlations between income and incidence observed in prior research likely reflect strongly consumption habits (which are closely tied to education), rather than living conditions per se, which are more directly influenced by income alone.

### Health Indicators and Lifestyle Factors

A few variables consistently stand out. The percentage of the hospital population diagnosed with tobacco addiction is significant and positively associated with incidence rates across both BV and arrondissement levels, and in both Poisson and Negative Binomial models.

The number of gyms per 1,000 inhabitants is significant at the BV level. While not statistically significant at the arrondissement level, the similarity in coefficient magnitude suggests this is more likely a matter of limited statistical power than a true absence of effect.

Vitamin D and calcium deficiencies exhibit alternating significance across arrondissement and BV levels. Removing one of the two tends to decrease the p-value of the other. However, it is important to note that diagnostic hospital data on nutriment deficiencies may not be reliable a proxy for population-level nutritional status, as they may also capture prevalent local conditions. To better evaluate the vitamin D hypothesis, we will rely on non-diagnostic variables in a subsequent fixed effects model.

### Environmental and Contextual Variables

Butcheries are significant only at the arrondissement level. Interestingly, when this variable is excluded from the model, the number of fast food establishments becomes significant, suggesting some overlapping or substitutive influence on dietary exposure. Assault and battery rates are also significant, but only at the arrondissement level.

$\text{NO}_2$ concentrations exhibit a small but significant negative effect on incidence. This finding is counterintuitive and appears sensitive to the inclusion of control variables. Therefore, we refrain from drawing strong conclusions from this coefficient.

### Water Quality and Climate 
Variables relating to water quality are not significant with the inclusion of an interaction term with tap water consumption. The proportion of homes with air conditioning (AC) is not always independently significant. However, when interacted with average summer temperatures, AC appears to moderate the positive effect of higher temperatures on incidence. Unfortunately, we are unable to test this interaction at the BV2022 level due to the lack of reliable weather data.

## Poisson Heterogeneity by Sex

To complement the previous estimates and enable comparisons with existing literature, we analyze the heterogeneity of effects by sex. This analysis is based on a restricted sample consisting only of incident patients. As a result, the estimates may be noisier, particularly because some geographic units report zero incident cases. For this reason, we limit the heterogeneous analysis to the arrondissement level. Specifically, Model (1) is a Negative Binomial (NB) regression for females, Model (2) is an NB model for males, Model (3) is a Poisson model for females, and Model (4) is a Poisson model for males.

```{python}
#| results: asis
#| output: asis
#| tbl-cap: "Subgroup Heterogeneity"

print(build_table(
        MAIN_RESULTS[MAIN_RESULTS['description'].str.endswith(("male", "female"))],
        include_pval=False,
        midrule_after=26,
        exclude_pattern=default_pattern
    ))
```

\newpage 

Consistent with prior literature, tobacco addiction is significantly associated with increased incidence only among males. The effect is not statistically significant in the female-only sample.

A similar pattern of heterogeneity is observed with the presence of butchers, which appears to affect men more than women. One possible explanation is that males may drive demand for butchers to a greater extent than females, though this remains speculative.

The principal component PC3, previously characterized as reflecting lower to middle education, is also more strongly associated with increased incidence among males. This may suggest lower-quality consumption habits among less-educated men.

Finally, the number of assaults per 1,000 inhabitants is positively associated with incidence for both sexes, with a slightly stronger effect observed among females. This may reflect the well-documented phenomenon that feelings of insecurity are more prevalent among women than men [REFERENCE].

## Poisson Fixed Effects

### Motivation

As previously mentioned, drawing inference from observational data is inherently challenging, especially in the context of ecological inference. Our estimates can vary substantially depending on the inclusion and specification of control variables. For some covariates, we can mitigate this issue by leveraging a time dimension through the use of fixed effects. Fixed effects models are a powerful tool in causal inference, as they absorb all time-invariant unobserved heterogeneity across observational units.

Given the limitations of our data, which includes only one year of observations, only a few variables are suitable for this approach, most notably, monthly weather data. We deliberately avoid using diagnostic hospital data in fixed effects models, as these are subject to seasonal fluctuations in healthcare utilization, potentially introducing population bias. In contrast, weather data should be exogenous and not influenced by such factors. To ensure adequate variability and avoid sparsity (i.e., a high frequency of zeros), we conduct this analysis at the *department* level. Fixed effects estimates are computed using an IRLS-based algorithm with fixed-point acceleration (REFERENCE: FENLnm).

The key objective of this FE analysis is to test the vitamin D hypothesis regarding Type 1 Diabetes (T1D) incidence. Since sunlight exposure is crucial for human vitamin D synthesis [REFERENCE_A; REFERENCE_B], and vitamin D levels typically decline in winter due to limited sun exposure and storage capacity [REFERENCE_C], we investigate whether increased sunshine is associated with reduced T1D incidence, controlling for other meteorological factors.

### Sunshine Effects 

Our findings support this hypothesis. Controlling for department fixed effects and other monthly weather variables, the number of sunny days per month shows a statistically significant negative association with the T1D incidence rate (IRR = 0.962, p < 0.01). Ceteris paribus, an additional sunny day per month is associated with approximately a 3.8% decrease in the monthly T1D incidence rate within a department. We also tested the inclusion of one-month lags for the weather variables. While the effects appear stronger, they are slightly noisier, due to our short time series. Each additional lag reducing the number of usable observations per department by one.

### Sunshine Heterogeneity

To further strengthen our interpretation, we assess whether the effect of sunshine is more pronounced in regions with lower dietary intake of vitamin D. Such a pattern would be consistent with the idea that sunlight captures vitamin D in our population. Our results indicate that in low-consumption regions, the negative effect of sunlight on T1D incidence is slightly stronger, though also noisier.[^1] Nevertheless, the effect remains statistically significant in both high- and low-consumption regions, lending support to the vitamin D interpretation.

[^1]: Note that the difference is not *statistcally* significant

Model dispersion is limited, indicating that a Poisson specification is appropriate. The model’s pseudo-$R^2$ ranges from 33% to nearly 50%, largely due to the inclusion of fixed effects. Detailed regression tables can be found in Annex A.4.

\newpage 

### Sunshine and Vitamin D
As a final validation step, we test whether the noisy vitamin D deficiency variable from Section 5.1 is indeed related to sunlight exposure and thus serves as a proxy for population-level deficiency. We estimate a fixed effects linear model:
$$Y_{it} = \alpha_i + \text{sunshine}_{it} + \text{visits}_{it} + \varepsilon_{it} $$
Where the dependent variable $Y_{it}$ is the share of hospital patients diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency in department $i$ at month $t$. We explain this $Y_{it}$ by a department fixed effect $\alpha_i$, the number of sunny days and where we attempt to controll for seasonality using the number of monthly hopistal visits in the department.

```{python}
#| results: asis
#| output: asis
#| tbl-cap: "Sunshine and Vitamin D"

VITD_WEATHER = pd.read_csv("results_analysis/poisson-fixed_effects.csv")

VITD_WEATHER = (
    VITD_WEATHER[VITD_WEATHER['description'].str.contains("corr")]
        .assign(
            variable = lambda d: d['variable'].replace({
                "inst":  "Sunshine (days)",
                "visit": "N. Hospital Visits"
            })
        )
        .rename(columns={'nobs': 'N. Observations'})
)

print(build_table(
        VITD_WEATHER,
        include_pval=False,
        midrule_after=13,
        pattern_keep = r'inst$',
        model_stat_names=['N. Observations', 'pseudo_r2', 'description'], 
        expo=False
    ))
```

We find that ceteris paribus, an additional 24 hours of sunshine per month in a department is associated with a 0.015 percentage point *decrease* in vitamin D deficiency, in relative term equivalent to a 2.7% relative decrease. The model's $R^2$ is 92.5%, with roughly 10% of the variation explained by time-varying covariates. This supports the interpretation that hospital-diagnosed vitamin D deficiency plausibly reflects true population-level variation.

### Remark

While these fixed effects analyses significantly strengthen the evidence by controlling for time-invariant confounders, we maintain caution regarding causal claims based solely on this observational study. Establishing a definitive causal link between vitamin D (proxied by sunshine) and T1D would require further research, ideally with longer time series allowing for more extensive time-varying controls. Furthermore, these results represent ecological associations at the department level, which do not automatically translate to individual-level causal effects.

\newpage

## Double Debiased ML 

### Motivation 

While fixed effects models allow leveraging the time dimension for certain variables, they cannot be applied to time-invariant characteristics or when panel data is unsuseable for specific factors of interest, such as tobacco addiction patterns derived from hospital data. To estimate the potential causal effect of such variables, we turn to Double Machine Learning (DML). Conceptually, DML, like matching methods, aims to compare observational units that are very similar across a range of characteristics (X) but differ in their level of a specific "treatment" variable (D). We employ DML within a partially linear framework, assuming the outcome (Y, T1D incidence) and treatment (D) models can be represented as:
$$Y = D \theta_0 + g_0(X) + \zeta, \quad \text{where } E[\zeta | D, X] = 0$$
$$D = m_0(X) + V, \quad \text{where } E[V | X] = 0$$
Where, $Y$ is the outcome variable, $D$ is the treatment variable, $\theta_0$ is the target causal parameter, $X$ are the confounding variables, $g_0(X) = E[Y | X]$ and $m_0(X) = E[D | X]$ are unknown nuisance functions, $\zeta$ and $V$ are error terms.

A key advantage of DML is its use of machine learning (ML) techniques to flexibly estimate nuisance functions without strong parametric assumptions, which also aids in handling high-dimensional X (variable selection). We utilized Random Forests as the ML learner for both, chosen for its flexibility in capturing complex relationships and its implicit variable selection. This data-driven estimation of nuisance components avoids injecting strong prior beliefs into that part of the model. Further details on the DML methodology are provided in Annex A.Z.

This DML analysis was applied to several variables identified as potentially important from the previous models. Due to computational constraints these models were estimated only at the arrondissement level.[^virtual] Checks related to the common support assumption and the predictive performance of the first-stage models are discussed in Annex A.5 and were found to be broadly acceptable.

[^virtual]: The analysis was performed on a virtual machine with limited resources (2 vCPUs, no GPU), preventing parallelization of cross-validation or extensive hyperparameter tuning for the Random Forest learners.

\vspace{-0.3cm}  We find a clear and statistically significant positive effect of the share of the hospital population diagnosed with tobacco addiction on T1D incidence, significant at the 1% level.[^tabacco] When analyzing by sex, the estimates become noisier: the effect remains significant for males (at the 10% level) but is not significant for females. While we cannot interpret tobacco use as an individual-level risk factor, due to the risk of ecological fallacy, the robustness of this finding across multiple models and subpopulations supports the conclusion that tobacco consumption at the population level increases the risk of T1D, particularly among males. Additionally, the number of fast food establishments is marginally significant, falling just below the 5% threshold. This result contributes to the growing body of evidence suggesting that unhealthy consumption behaviors within a population are associated with increased T1D incidence.

No other variables reach our choosen level of statistical significance (10%). Notably, the previously observed counterintuitive negative association with NO$_2$ concentrations is no longer statistically significant.  Other environmental variables, such as insecurity, proxied by the number of assaults, are also not statistically significant. However, we did not exclude other crime-related variables from the model, this is a limitation of our use of DML. For some variables we don't have clear enough causal relationship to test and as such we may suffer from collider bias.
